# keeporegongreen
A WordPress starter theme, also a chihuahua living in Portland OR.  

This template is meant to give developers a nice clean starting point for building a WordPress theme. It blends the wonderful `functions.php` file from `html5blank`, the file structure of Hugo Graudel's `Sass Boilerplate`, and `Gulp` to automate workflow.  

Feel free to re-name and all-around do whatever you want to with this project. Just keep in mind that neither myself or my chihuahua are responsible for anything that happens when you start modifying this theme.  

#### This project is still a work-in-progress. I plan on adding/improving several features over the coming months. I also plan on writing better documentation.

### This theme is inspired by and borrows from:  
  - [html5blank](http://html5blank.com/)
  - [Sass Boilerplate](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate)
